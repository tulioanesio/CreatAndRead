# Create and Read 

The **Name List Manager** is a simple web site that allows you to store names in an array and list them later. It demonstrates basic CRUD operations, focusing on **Create** (adding names) and **Read** (listing names).

## How It Works

1. **Add a Name**: You can input a name, and it will be stored in an array.
2. **List Names**: You can view all the names stored in the array.
