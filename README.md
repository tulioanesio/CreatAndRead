# Name List Manager

Name List Manager is a simple web application that allows you to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of names. The application stores the names in an array, enabling you to add, view, update, and delete names as needed. This project serves as a great introduction to basic data manipulation using JavaScript.

## How It Works

1. **Add a name**: You can input a name, and it will be stored in an array.
2. **List names**: You can view all the names stored in the array.
3. **Update a name**: You can input a old name, and update it through a prompt, this name will be stored in an array.
4. **Delete a name**: You can delete a name you put in input, and then the array will be updated.
